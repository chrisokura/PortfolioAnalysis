# PortfolioAnalysis
To see the output of the data tables and graphs created through the R code look at the word documents "Portfolio Analysis Part 2" and "Portfolio Analysis Part 1"

Portfolio analysis performed in R Studio. The code looks at historical return data of four stocks, Boeing (BA), Microsoft (MSFT), General Electric (GE), and Oracle (ORCL).
Asset statistics are estimated using the constant expected returns model. Parameter statistics are estimated using data from 1987-2018 with confidence intervals to adjust for the fact that data is estimated from a finite sample size.
Possible portfolio allocations and their associated portfolio statistics are calculated. These allocations can then be used to match the mean-variance or mean-standard deviation preference for different investors.
